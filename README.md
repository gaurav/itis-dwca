=========

A DwC-A version of the ITIS taxonomic database, by
permission of the ITIS Data Specialized. I download
the [database dump from the ITIS website](http://www.itis.gov/downloads/index.html),
then use [dwca-hunter](https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/dwca-hunter)
by the [Global Names Architecture](http://globalnames.org/) to generate
a DwC-A file from ITIS.

Please note that all data used from the DwC-A file should be credited to
ITIS as follows: Retrieved [month, day, year], from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) (http://www.itis.gov). The month/day/year can be
available from the first line of the version.txt file.

Please [report any issues you notice with this distribution](https://github.com/gaurav/itis-dwca/issues), and use at your own risk!
